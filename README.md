# Financical Version 1.0
A financial transaction application made for a course project. 

This project was made for submission to the CNG 352: Database Management Systems II Course

## Backend
The database was built using MySQL. 
Several queries (simple and complex) were written as per the requirements of the course

## Frontend
The styling was done using CSS.  
The webpages were implemented using PHP


## To Run Program  
You will need to download the MySQL files and upload them on a server (I used XAMPP)  
Open the login.php page and use one of the DB users or create a new account to get access to the dashboard.

### Major Issue
I was not able to get the form for adding new financial transactions to work. Quite a big flaw in an applciation whose sole purpose is to track financial transactions, but I had hard time getting PHP to work.

This was my first experience working on a program in a team, so most of the code is a bit messy and not well commented.
